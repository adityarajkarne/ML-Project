Investigation and comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms

Project descriptionThe purpose of this project is to compare supervised and unsupervised learning
algorithms. We examined decision trees, supervised learning algorithm
alongside K-Means, an unsupervised learning algorithm.
We took two datasets Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a database whose objective
is to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements and Monk's
problems database consisting of three databases for the three subproblems.
We also implemented them with Weka so as to compare with their Weka
counterparts and gain some more insights.
Finally, we compare their results and narrow down what makes them unique and
why as well as when a particular algorithm will serve well over the other.
